My program is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is run by running the main method in the “Game” class. It is meant for two players at the same computer that will take turns entering input. When you run the program, the rules and the expected user input will be printed to the screen so you will know exactly what to enter. First, the program asks Player 1 to enter whether they’d like to be X’s or O’s, and will assign Player 2 the opposite of whatever Player 1 picked. Then, it prints an example board with numbers in the slots and explains how to enter in your input. You pick a number 1-9 based on the example board that is printed. Before the game begins, however, there is a guessing game. The computer picks a number 1-100, and the players enter in a guess; whoever gets closest to the computer’s number gets to make the first move. Once that is decided, the game begins. My program is completely crash/error-proof. So, for example, if you enter a String when you were prompted for an int, the program will not crash; it will simply prompt you to try again. If you are entering a number and put in a number outside of the range (there are two instances of this in the program: one where you enter a number 1-9, and another where you enter a number 1-100), it will restate that you need to enter a number in that specific range. If you try to play on a slot that has already been played on, it will once again prompt you to try again, telling you that that slot has already been played. There are also a few instances in the code that you will probably not see run, almost like Easter eggs. For example, at the beginning of each game, during the guessing game, a different string will print if you guess the number spot on. It’s not much, but it adds more depth to the program on the off change that you do guess it spot on. It is also in a loop to prevent errors, so if you tie, you just play again. Another thing is that at the end, I made sure that when it states how many games you’ve won, it is grammatically correct. So, if you have one win, it will say that you have “1 win” rather than “1 wins” or even something like “1 win(s)”. Once again, it’s not much -- just one letter -- but I think it makes the program look a little “smarter,” if you will. The whole program is in a loop, so you can choose to play as much as you’d like. It will tell you at the end of each game who won, and at the very end, once you decide not to play any more games, it will tell you how many times Player 1 won and how many times Player 2 won, and who was the winner of the most games.  

Below is an example of the pre-game output. First, it prompts Player 1 to enter “X” or “O” and makes Player 2 an X or an O player based on what Player 1 picked. Here, Player 1 chose to be X’s, so Player 2 is O’s. All of this appears at the beginning of each game, so you can change it if you’d like. Next it prints the example board, showing you the 9 slots and explaining how to play. Before the Tic-Tac-Toe game begins, there is a number guessing game. Whoever wins this gets to make the first move in Tic-Tac-Toe. The computer chooses a number, and the 2 players enter their guesses. As stated before, this program is error/crash-proof, so feel free to enter in incorrect input. It will simply prompt you again each time you enter something incorrect. After the first player is decided by this game (by whoever gets closest to the number), the game of Tic-Tac-Toe begins. Below this image is an image of a completed Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Here is an example of a completed program. I decided to play 3 games by entering “Y” at the end of each individual game. At the end of the third one, I entered “N” and the program stopped. It prints the total number of wins for each player. In this case, Player 1 had the most wins with 2.
